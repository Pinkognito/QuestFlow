val nextLevelTotal = (currentLevel + 1)¬≤ √ó 100
val xpReward = (nextLevelTotal * percentage / 100)

// Example Level 26‚Üí27:
// Total: 72,900 XP

## üß™ Debug Test Data System

### Overview
The app includes a comprehensive test data initialization system for development and testing.
**File**: `DebugDataInitializer.kt`

### Automatic Initialization
- Triggers on first app install (checks for Debug category existence)
- All initialization runs in a single database transaction for consistency
- **Robust**: Will re-initialize if app data is cleared

### Test Data Contents
**Generated on every fresh install:**
- **2 Contacts** (Fabian Test 1 & 2) with complete metadata:
  - Phone: +4915159031829
  - Email: fabian_beckmann@outlook.de
  - Address: Baumgarten 42, 27654 Bremerhaven
- **3 Locations**: Bremerhaven (home), Berlin (office), M√ºnchen (branch)
- **5 Text Templates**: Meeting invites, reminders, status updates, phone notes, project kickoffs
- **5 Global Tags**: VIP, Dringend, Privat, Arbeit, B√ºro
- **39 Comprehensive Tasks**:
  - 13 completed historical tasks (-30 to -1 days)
  - 2 current tasks (today)
  - 24 future tasks (+1 to +30 days)
  - All dates relative to `LocalDateTime.now()` (stays relevant for 3+ months)
  - Mix of priorities (URGENT, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Various XP percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%)
  - Parent-child task relationships demonstrated
  - Recurring tasks with all trigger modes (FIXED_INTERVAL, AFTER_COMPLETION, AFTER_EXPIRY)
- **39 Calendar Links**: One for each task with a dueDate
  - Status: CLAIMED (completed), EXPIRED (past incomplete), PENDING (future)
  - Enables XP claiming system testing
- **XP Transactions**: Generated for all completed tasks (enables statistics)
- **4 Skills**: Global XP boost, Task master, Streak guardian, Debug specialist
- **User Stats**: Level 5 with 15,000 XP and 12 skill points

### Time-Relative Data
All task dates use `LocalDateTime.now()` as the reference point:
- **Past**: `now.minusDays(30)` to `now.minusDays(1)` ‚Äî completed tasks for statistics
- **Present**: `now.withHour(X)` ‚Äî current day tasks
- **Future**: `now.plusDays(1)` to `now.plusDays(30)` ‚Äî upcoming tasks

This ensures test data remains relevant even months after implementation.

### Usage for Statistics
The test data is specifically designed to enable testing of:
- **XP trend charts**: 13 completed tasks with XP transactions over 30 days
- **Task completion rates**: Mix of completed and active tasks
- **Calendar integration**: All tasks have calendar links for XP claiming
- **Category analytics**: All tasks assigned to Debug category
- **Time distribution**: Tasks spread evenly across 60-day span

### Persistence Guarantee
Test data will ALWAYS be recreated on fresh installs because:
1. `shouldInitialize()` checks for Debug category existence
2. Category is only created after successful full initialization
3. Database transaction ensures atomic creation (all-or-nothing)
4. App data clear (`adb shell pm clear`) triggers re-initialization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Technical Debt

### Performance
- SyncManager runs every 60s (consider 5-15 min)
- Large screens need component extraction (CalendarXpScreen 989 lines)

### Code Organization
- Task dialogs could be consolidated
- Recurring tasks backend disabled (UI ready)
- Some entity fields marked for deprecation

## üêõ Previously Applied Fixes

### Historical Fixes
- WorkManager initialization conflict resolved
- Priority enum mapping (HARD‚ÜíHIGH)
- Dialog scrollability implemented
- XP formula changed to total-based

## üöÄ Development Notes

### Testing Checklist
1. Build with `./gradlew.bat assembleDebug`
2. Install with `adb install -r [apk]`
3. Check logs with `adb logcat | grep -i questflow`
4. Test XP calculations at different levels

### Important Use Cases
- `UpdateTaskWithCalendarUseCase` - Centralized task updates with calendar sync
- `CalculateXpRewardUseCase` - XP calculations based on level and percentage
- `GrantXpUseCase` - XP granting with skill multipliers
- `RecordCalendarXpUseCase` - Calendar event XP claiming

## üë§ User Preferences

### Fabian's Preferences
- **XP Numbers**: Likes seeing big, growing numbers (motivational)
- **Language**: German UI text, English technical terms
- **Testing**: Always wants APK installed after changes
- **Debugging**: Prefers detailed ADB log analysis

### Design Decisions
- XP scales exponentially (not linear)
- Animations adapt to number size
- German difficulty names kept
- Thousands separators in XP display

## üìù Pending Features
1. Streak system implementation
2. Settings screen
3. Subtask support
4. Achievement badges
5. Statistics dashboard

## ‚ö° CRITICAL: Development Workflow

### üîÑ Mandatory Workflow for EVERY Task

When receiving a new task/feature request (not a fix for previous task):

1. **Git Commit Previous Work**
   - Automatically commit and push if new feature request
   - Assumption: Previous task was completed successfully

2. **Task Analysis Phase** (ULTRATHINKING)
   - Deeply analyze the request
   - Cross-reference with existing project structure
   - Check Android device logs for last app execution
   - Consider ALL potential impacts and side effects

3. **Planning Phase**
   - Create comprehensive implementation plan
   - Identify potential chain reactions in other parts
   - Plan strategic debug points (not redundant)
   - Consider preventive measures for issues

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Execute plan without breaking existing features
   - Preserve all working functionality unless explicitly replacing
   - Add intelligent debug logs at critical points
   - Maintain code integrity and patterns

5. **Pre-Deployment Review**
   - Double-check implementation matches requirements
   - Verify no unintended side effects
   - Ensure debug strategy is complete
   - Final code review for issues

6. **Deployment Phase**
   - Build APK with `./gradlew.bat assembleDebug`
   - Install on device with `adb install -r [apk]`
   - Monitor logs for immediate feedback

### üéØ Workflow Rules

- **NO USER INPUT REQUESTS**: Complete entire workflow in one response
- **ULTRATHINKING**: Take time to think deeply, quality over speed
- **FOCUS**: Stay strictly on task, no unnecessary additions
- **SINGLE RESPONSE**: Only contact user when task is 100% complete
- **GIT DISCIPLINE**: Commit/push at start of new features automatically

### üß† Implementation Philosophy

- **Quality First**: Use as many tokens as needed for best result
- **Deep Analysis**: Consider every angle and impact
- **Strategic Debugging**: Smart placement of debug logs
- **Preserve Stability**: Never break working features
- **User Trust**: Complete tasks fully before reporting back
